            <div class="card-content">
                <p>Powerlifting competitions are designed to test the maximum strength of competitors in three main lifts: the squat, the bench press, and the deadlift. Each lifter has three attempts for each lift, and the highest successful lift in each category is recorded.</p>
                <p><strong>Squat:</strong> The lifter must lower their body until their thighs are parallel to the ground or below, then return to a standing position with the barbell on their shoulders.</p>
                <p><strong>Bench Press:</strong> While lying on a bench, the lifter lowers the barbell to their chest and then presses it back up to arm’s length.</p>
                <p><strong>Deadlift:</strong> The lifter pulls the barbell from the ground to hip level while keeping their back straight and using their legs and hips.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="card">
            <div class="card-title">Scoring System</div>
            <div class="card-content">
                <p>The lifter’s final score is the total of their highest successful attempts in each of the three lifts. The lifter with the highest total score wins. If there is a tie, the lifter with the lighter body weight is declared the winner.</p>
                <p><strong>Example:</strong> If Lifters A and B both achieve a total of 600 kg, but Lifters A weighs 90 kg and Lifters B weighs 95 kg, Lifters A will be the winner.</p>
